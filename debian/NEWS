prometheus-node-exporter (0.18.1+ds-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  This release removes the bundled textfile collector example scripts, since
  they have been moved to an alternate upstream git repository. The scripts
  and their associated systemd services / timers have been moved to the new
  Debian package, prometheus-node-exporter-collectors.

  If you have apt configured to not install "Recommends" package dependencies,
  you will need to install the new prometheus-node-exporter-collectors package
  manually.

prometheus-node-exporter (0.16.0+ds-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Breaking changes

  This release contains major breaking changes to metric names.  Many metrics
  have new names, labels, and label values in order to conform to current
  naming conventions.

  * Linux node_cpu metrics now break out `guest` values into separate metrics.
    See Issue #737
  * Many counter metrics have been renamed to include `_total`.
  * Many metrics have been renamed/modified to include base units, for example
    `node_cpu` is now `node_cpu_seconds_total`.

  In order to help with the transition check the upgrade guide at
  /usr/share/docs/prometheus-node-exporter/V0_16_UPGRADE_GUIDE.md.

  Other breaking changes:
  * The megacli collector has been removed, is now replaced by the storcli.py
    textfile helper.
  * The gmond collector has been removed.
  * The textfile collector will now treat timestamps as errors.

prometheus-node-exporter (0.15.2+ds-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Breaking changes

  This release contains major breaking changes to flag handling.
  * The flag library has been changed, all flags now require double-dashs.
    (`-foo` becomes `--foo`).
  * The collector selection flag has been replaced by individual boolean
    flags.
  * The `-collector.procfs` and `-collector.sysfs` flags have been renamed to
    `--path.procfs` and `--path.sysfs` respectively.

  The `ntp` collector has been replaced with a new NTP-based check that is
  designed to expose the state of a localhost NTP server rather than provide
  the offset of the node to a remote NTP server.  By default the `ntp`
  collector is now locked to localhost.  This is to avoid accidental spamming
  of public internet NTP pools.
